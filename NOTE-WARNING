Gdbm files have never been `portable' between different operating systems,
system architectures, or potentially even different compilers.  Differences
in byte order, the size of file offsets, and even structure packing make
gdbm files non-portable.

Gdbm version 1.9.0 includes `large file' support, enabling it on operating
systems where it is not the default.  `Large file' support is essentially
when a system uses 64bit file offsets.  Gdbm has, of course, supported `large
files' on systems where it was the default for a very long time.

On some systems, such as Solaris, this functionality is not enabled by
default.  Gdbm will now enable it.  THIS MEANS THAT GDBM 1.9.0 MAY NOT BE
ABLE TO ACCESS DATABASES CREATED BY PREVIOUS VERIONS ON THE SAME SYSTEM.

Running the `configure' script with the `--disable-largefile' flag should
produce a backwards-compatible build on such a system.  However, for maximum
compatibility, and increased functionality, you may want to have your
application produce a portable copy of your database with the 1.8.3 version
of the library, and then load it back into version 1.9.0.
